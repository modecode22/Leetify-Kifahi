# About
Different social media's AI algorithms try to delete and hide some posts related to events occurring globally, especially those with political orientations that conflict with the orientations and opinions of the founders of those sites or some governments. Leetify-Kifahi is a simple web app to obfuscate French and English text, inspired by the 1337Speak language, with a primary objective of keeping text as understandable by humans as possible and not by AI algorithms.
